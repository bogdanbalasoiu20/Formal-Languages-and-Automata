# Formal-Languages-and-Automata
This repository provides a **comprehensive suite of tools** for working with **formal languages and automata theory**, including **checkers and emulators** for **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**, **Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**, and **Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**. It enables users to **define, simulate, and validate** automata and grammars, offering an interactive way to explore their behavior and properties. Designed for **efficiency and accuracy**, this project serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and developers working with computational models and language processing.
